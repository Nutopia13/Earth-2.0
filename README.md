# Earth-2.0

This is a random generator project which is themed around a possible habitat planets.

## General Information

The intention of this project is to practice using git, github, markdown and visual studio code to create a project outside of the codeacademy environment.
The most struggle was to divide Heading and Description elements, while they are in the object. So came up with a solution: Changed to one object and several keys who hold title as a first index and description as a second index. Then looped and .push to new array
Would appreciate some feedback :slight_smile: Thank you for your time
